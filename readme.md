# Simple calculator app for TOP

## JS pseudo code

1. build functions for each math operators :
   i. add
   ii. subtract
   iii. multiply
   iv. divide
2. build function for operation with two operands
3. build functions to populate the display every time a button is clicked, keystroke would be nice too. Don't forget to store the value of each button
4. add another function to display the result

## HTML/CSS to do

1. create a calculator with:
   - display,
   - buttons for digits,
   - all operators (including equal)

### Thoughts

would using an array to store digits be a good idea? if yes how could operatorsbe store? when should we send to the array?
